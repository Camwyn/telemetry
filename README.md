# Schema Builder

A library for Opt-in and Telemetry data to be sent to the StellarWP Telemetry server.

## Installation

It's recommended that you install Telemetry as a project dependency via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require stellarwp/telemetry
```


> We _actually_ recommend that this library gets included in your project using [Strauss](https://github.com/BrianHenryIE/strauss).
>
> Luckily, adding Strauss to your `composer.json` is only slightly more complicated than adding a typical dependency, so checkout our [strauss docs](https://github.com/stellarwp/global-docs/blob/main/docs/strauss-setup.md).
